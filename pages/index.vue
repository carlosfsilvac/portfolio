      For the past 6 years, I have been working on web development projects.
      Here, you can find some of my past work and what I am currently working
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript, I have mostly worked as a
      front-end developer throughout my career. I have always had a keen
      interest in UI/UX and creating interfaces that provide a good user
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I spend my free time developing personal and client projects,
      <a href="blog">writing articles</a>, and creating content about Vue
      <UIcon class="h-4 w-4" name="i-mdi-vuejs" /> and Nuxt
      <UIcon name="i-mdi-nuxt" />. I believe that sharing knowledge is one of
      the best ways to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love spending time with my family, practicing sports, and traveling. I
      enjoy reading about psychology, philosophy, and technology. Developing
      self-awareness is something I consider <i>essential</i>.
